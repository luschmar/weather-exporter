# weather-exporter

Exporter for prometheus. Exports weather data from a eurochron EFWS 2900
weather station, and converts it to a prometheus scrapable format.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This project is retired. It was just a rapid prototype. The docker image was 288MB big. Please take
the go successor [go-wunderground-exporter](https://github.com/luschmar/go-wunderground-exporter).
